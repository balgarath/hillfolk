Hillfolks Production evolved from Hippie Hill Productions.  We are a non-profit 
organization inspiried by helping people of limited means get back on their feet
and stay off the streets away from harms way.  We are commited to encouraging the
talents of the folks who join our community including artists, poets, photographers,
and musicians.  We come across so many amazing and creative people and we try and
do what we can to help them succeed.

We promote events, facilitate booking, and provide a state-of-the-art recording
studio for both local and travelling artists/musicians.  We like to help our
community in any way possible; we can set up charity events for causes such as
cancer, autism, epilepsy, and for organizations such as St. Judes and Shiners. 
We want to help, and we have the sound, lighting, musicians, event tents, and
networking to make it happen.
