We have had the privelege of having so many talented musicians come play amazing
shows on the stage.  We ask them, "Where are your CDs?  We want to help spread
your music around."  They tell us they don't have one, they haven't been in a 
studio, can't afford it, its expensive.

So we decided we were going to build a studio, help people get their music out there.
There are so many amazing people out there that can't get their music recorded
in a way that does justice to the music, and we want to help them.  This is
just another way to reach out to people like we've always done.

We've got state-of-the-art equipment available, and we're willing to work with what
people can afford.  For us its not about making money, its about spreading music 
and love.
